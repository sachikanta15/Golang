IN other language the memory management is done by manually but in go the memory allocation and deallocation is happens automatically

In the memory management basically we are using new() and make() method 

                     new()                             |               make()
                    * allocation of memory and         | * allocation of memeory and initilization
                     no initilization                     | *  you will get memory address
                    * you will get memeory address     | * non-zeroed storage
                    * zeroed storage                   |
             * zeroed storage menas we can't 
             put any data                              |  * non-zeroed storage means we can put data
                                                       |
                                                       |
                                                       |


Garbage collection happens automatically
out of the scope or nil

runtime is the package in which we can get the cpu usage stup like that
